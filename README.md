## Abstract
Cities all over the world struggle with air pollution. With the ever-increasing concentration of people in urban areas, more and more people suffer from the negative effects of air pollutants. Crowdsensing systems are a unique chance to increase the users' awareness of this problem and to provide more fine-grained data to policymakers so that they can adopt appropriate strategies. In this paper, we present a crowdsensing system to collect air pollution in urban and suburban environments through the use of bicycles. It consists of a Web application, enriched with gamification elements, that communicates with a portable low-cost sensor. The user interface of such a system, as well as the adopted gamification mechanisms, has been designed by involving a group of target users, with the aim of better meeting users' preferences and needs, and, then, better engaging them.

## Development server

### Setup

1) Install MongoDB, Node, Angular.

2) `npm install` in the *root dir* **and** also in */airmatter-api*

3) Create a database in MongoDb called *airmatter*, and a collection called *users*

4) Replace [YOUR-KEY] with a Google Maps API Key in /src/index.html (when the repo will be public, I will disable the key present before this commit).

### Run

1) Run the MongoDB server. If installed with brew:

    `brew services start mongodb-community`

2) Run `npm start` from airmatter-api to run the back-end server

3) Run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json` for the front-server. 

4) Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

5) [Optional] download and use ngrok for outdoor testing `./ngrok http 4200 -host-header="localhost:4200"`
